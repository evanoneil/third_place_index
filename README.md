## Updates in v1.1
- **Fixed Known issue with CT data**
- **GEOID Formatting Change** - 1.1 uses the standard 11-digit format (for example: 01001020100)

## Overview

The Third Place Index measures the availability of "third places" - community gathering spaces beyond home (first place) and work (second place) - at the census tract level across the United States. The concept originates from sociologist Ray Oldenburg's 1989 book *The Great Good Place*.

Third places include cafes, restaurants, libraries, parks, community centers, fitness centers, and other spaces where people gather for social interaction and community building.

### Key Features

- **National coverage**: All 50 states plus Washington, D.C.
- **Tract-level precision**: 83,531 census tracts
- **Percentile-based scoring**: Tracts ranked relative to all U.S. tracts
- **Detailed breakdowns**: Counts by category and individual place type

## Methodology

### Place Data Collection

Third place locations were collected from OpenStreetMap (OSM) via the Overpass API. Locations were identified across the following categories:

Cafes, restaurants, bars, pubs, barber shops, salons, bookstores, convenience stores, marketplaces, libraries, community centers, places of worship, parks, gardens, plazas, theaters, cinemas, arts centers, fitness centers, coworking spaces, bowling alleys, arcades, escape rooms, and malls.

### Index Calculation

The Third Place Index uses a **percentile-based methodology** :

1. Census tracts are ranked by total third place count
2. Rankings are converted to percentile scores (0.00 to 1.00)
3. A score of **0.75** means the tract has more third places than 75% of all U.S. tracts

**Interpretation**:
- 0.75 - 1.00: High availability
- 0.50 - 0.75: Above average
- 0.25 - 0.50: Below average
- 0.00 - 0.25: Limited availability ("third place desert")

## Data Sources

- **Place Data**: OpenStreetMap contributors (2025) via Overpass API
- **Demographics**: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2022 5-Year Estimates
- **Geography**: U.S. Census Bureau, TIGER/Line Shapefiles 2020

## Limitations

- **OSM Coverage**: OpenStreetMap completeness varies by region; urban areas are generally better mapped than rural areas
- **Relative Measure**: The percentile score is relative, not absolute - it compares tracts to each other, not to an ideal standard
- **Presence vs. Quality**: The index measures presence of places, not their quality, accessibility, affordability, or actual usage
- **Point-in-Time**: Data represents a snapshot; third places open and close over time
